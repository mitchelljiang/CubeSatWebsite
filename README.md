# CubeSat Website

This repository contains my submission for the Web Developer position at UGA SSRL.

## Files Included
- `index.html`
- `styles.css`
- `images` (directory)

The `images` directory houses all of the image assets required for the website.

## Viewing the Webpage
To see the webpage, clone this repository using the following command:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/mitchelljiang/CubeSatWebsite.git
```

You can then either open index.html directly or, if you're using an IDE like Visual Studio Code, you can use the "Live Server" extension to host the webpage locally.

## Main Features
1. Reactive and fully functional Navigation Bar.
3. Static background.
4. Imported font.
5. Interactable but not implemented Contact-Us widget.

## Progress and Future Improvements
This webpage was created with zero prior knowledge of HTML/CSS. In the past week, I have learned a lot in terms of not only HTML/CSS but also UI/UX design principles and even a bit of JavaScript. There are a few features that I still plan to implement, but given the time constraint of this submission, I will not make the deadline. They are as follows:

1. Smoothing out NavBar animations: I would like to use the transition feature to smoothly scroll down or up to each section when the respective NavBar buttons are pressed.
2. Implementing the Contact Us widget: Currently, it has the looks and can read input. However, it can't do much else.
3. Typewriting illusion: I am currently working on some CSS and JavaScript scripts to make the illusion that content is being typed out as soon as the content reaches the user's screen. This involves animations, @keyframes, and a bit of JS that I am not able to implement just yet.
There are still many more things I plan to do, mainly involving UI/UX, but that is everything on my scope at the moment.

Thank you for your consideration!
