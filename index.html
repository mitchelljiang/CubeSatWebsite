                <h2>What are CubeSats?</h2>
                <p><br>
                    CubeSats are a class of miniature, modular satellites that have revolutionized access to space exploration. 
                    Measuring 10 centimeters per side and weighing no more than 1.33 kilograms per unit, CubeSats are equipped 
                    with essential components necessary for scientific research, technology demonstration, Earth observation, 
                    communication, and more.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We offer several advantages over traditional satellites, including reduced development and launch costs, 
                    shorter realization timelines, and the ability to deploy multiple CubeSats simultaneously. They are often 
                    deployed from larger spacecraft or launched into space alongside larger payloads, making them a cost-effective 
                    option for universities, research institutions, startups, and even larger space agencies.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Whether you're a student looking to gain hands-on experience in space research, a researcher aiming to conduct 
                    groundbreaking scientific experiments, or a company seeking to develop new space-based technologies, CubeSats 
                    provide a flexible and accessible platform to turn your ideas into reality and contribute to the future of 
                    space exploration. </p>

                <p> Climate Research:

                    The Spectral Ocean Color (SPOC) Satellite was a CubeSat mission developed by the University of Georgia SSRL program. 
                    Its objective was to perform the very fist moderate resolution multi-spectral analysis of vegetation health, primary 
                    productivity, ocean productivity, coastal sediment, organic life, and mapping the production of shelf waters and salt 
                    marshes. In addition, they sought to create a unique Georgia coastal imagery library that classified all the data gathered from SPOC. Launched from the Antares 230+ in 2020, the data serves to supplement the Georgia Coastal Ecosystems Long Term Ecological Research Program.</p>
